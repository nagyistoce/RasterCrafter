This is an MMO in the 2D top-down style of '90s RPGs like Zelda, or Pokemon. It was inspired by the sandbox aspects of Minecraft which people commonly use to create pixel art. The player walks around an infinte world of randomly generated tiles. The player can copy any tile they find to their inventory, or spend points to create copies. Tiles in the player's inventory can then be put down to create pixel-art. The player can use a lasso tool, to copy multiple tiles or resize them. Once a tile or set of tiles have been copied to a player's inventory they will randomly spawn all over the world. The player will get points each time another player makes a copy of a tile they created. Once a tile has been placed by a player it belongs to that player and cannot be changed up by anyone else. Players can set a home tile where they will spawn at the start of every game. Players can teleport to each other's home tiles. There are three layers to every tile which can be drawn to; a background (which players can walk over), foregrounds (which players walk under), and objects (which players cannot walk through). Players can also use tiles to customize their avatar. The only real goal of the game is to accumulate points by creating tiles that other players will want to copy. This will allow players to create copies of tiles they need to construct maps. These maps can be private houses, mazes, showcases of creations, or anything else players can imagine. Additional features might include monsters, keys, locks, switches, or pushable objects which players can use to create puzzles and dungeons.
